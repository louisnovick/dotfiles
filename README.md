Louis Novick's Dotfiles
==========================

Some configuration I'm attempting to keep organized.

Symlinks
--------

### Sublime Text

With Sublime Text installed via Brew Cask, use the following command to set up a
symbolic link to its packages:

```For Sublime Text.  In terminal...
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/sublime/User/ ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User
```
